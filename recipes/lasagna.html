    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I made up this lobster lasagna recipe because my hubby wanted to try a
      lasagna made with lobster meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I layer tender chunks of steamed Maine lobster with pasta, jarred or
      homemade Alfredo sauce, fresh spinach, and three types of cheese: ricotta,
      Cheddar, and Parmesan. Serve with a tossed garden salad and oven-toasted
      garlic bread.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>16 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place ricotta cheese into a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar, 1/2 cup
        mozzarella, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and eggs. Mix in onion, parsley, garlic,
        and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1 1/2 cups Alfredo sauce over the bottom of the prepared baking
        dish. Top with a layer of 4 lasagna noodles. Arrange 1/3 of the lobster
        meat over noodles, then cover with 1/3 of the spinach and another layer
        Alfredo sauce. Repeat layers twice more: noodles, lobster meat, spinach,
        and sauce. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan over
        top. Give the whole pan a gentle shake to get everything settled in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake in the preheated oven
        for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until cheese is
        browned, about 10 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
